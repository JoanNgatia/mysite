          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I have been a
            software engineer for the last 4 years, mainly working on web
            applications built in Python. Most recently, I have been working on
            apps that have expanded my skillset in Javascript with atleast 2
            years of dabbling in Node JS and React for the frontend application
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work at <a href="https://2u.com/">2U</a>, an education
            technology company, as a software engineer building out the
            marketing applications for the courses offered on 2U's digital
            platform. My responsibilities include building out the web CMS to
            manage both paid and organic marketing strategies, architecting and
            supporting user analytics, and setting up infrastructure monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current research interests are Infrastructure as Code
            technologies, like Terraform and Docker, and cybersecurity.
